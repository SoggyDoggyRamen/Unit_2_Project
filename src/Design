LinearEquation Class:

    Instance variables:
        private point1_x = x value of point 1
        private point1_y = y value of point 1
        private point2_x = x value of point 2
        private point2_y = y value of point 2
        private slope
        private y-intercept
        private equationForm
        private distance

    Constructor:
        public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
            takes in point 1 and 2 x and y values and assigns them to each variable accordingly

    Methods:
        void slope()
            gets the slope and store it in the variable slope
            run y-intercept

        void y-intercept()
            get the y-intercept and store it in the variable y-intercept
            run form

        void distance()
            get the distance and store it in variable distance

        void form()
            this.equationForm = slope + "x + " + y-intercept
            run distance

        String toString()
            String stuff = "all that information stuff"
            return stuff

        double solve(double x)
            double y = slope(x) + y-intercept
            return y


Runner Class
    get the x and y values
    call the constructor
    method slope
    print object
    ask for x
    solve for x and print
